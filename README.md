## What Is Pangolin?
pangolin is named after a animal with a shell (kinda like a armadillo) this UI is based on the capybara ui bringing a more complete look. We are adding android like icons bringing a more familiar atomsphere, and with a touch of chromeOS.

## To Use

To run Pangolin, you will need to have Flutter installed in your PATH, and a android device / chromebook or emulator to run it on.

## Important Style guide!
All dahlia applications MUST have a central theme color, that is not #ff5722, or material-deeporange or similar, as that is reserved for the system. Uploaders must upload a theme.txt in the root of their application, that contains the theme color, in preferably hexadecimal, but RGBA is acceptable as well. Uncompliant applications will have their theme colors set to a random color.
